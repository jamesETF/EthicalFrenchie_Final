## Why do we breed blue french bulldogs?

When it comes to breeding blues, we are aware of the risks behind poor breeding. That is why we take responsibility as our highest priority when selecting Frenchie mates for our breeding line. That means we only choose the best dogs to breed.
In particular, the males and females we choose have to meet with a certain health standard in which there are no presences of illness.
For the characteristics, we go for the best quality by testing and sorting out unhealthy canine individuals.
As a result, our "Blue Lines" stands out to be the most respected lines you can find on the legal market. You can find our dedicated work of the successful matings in such rare French bulldogs as Brad's Bullies - MicroMachine, Maximis- Go Frenchie's Trojanman - a limited triple carrier, Frenchie-World's Logan, and even the world's only Mr. Frenchie of Mystyle.

In brief, we prioritize HEALTH and QUALITY, then COLOR.

Many of our customers wonder what makes Frenchies an exotic breed from our breeding lab, while they can actually buy "cheap Frenchies" out there.
We don't compare our dogs with the crummy, irresponsible matings.
The reasons are simple. 

Those vile breeders don't take any responsibility when cross-breeding Frenchies with unhealthy dogs, or dogs with recessive genes. ThatThat results in morbid puppies that called "cheap dogs." When they sell the pups away, you will never meet them again and spend even more for medical bills for a sick dog.
We don't do that immoral business.
In fact, we are real-life Frenchies parents of twelve, taking care of them with all the love we have. We guess the combination of responsible breeding plus affection is the perfect magic making our dogs NEVER suffer any health problems. We provide nothing but the best diets, extreme care, healthy living space, and ultimate love from a true family.

We believe French Bulldogs have their distinctive beauty that deserves any admiration; especially the blue ones. We know blue Frenchies can bring us even more money, but we never produce in a mass.
When breeding a blue, we must work in the highest concentration which we spend on researching and learning about this rare color before jumping to the decision to breed. Right here, we are willing to share our discovery.
Through many studies, we learned that the blue color is an unusual dilute gene changes the coat from black to blue. This rare mutation is hyped to add more numbers in the price tag of a blue. But this is a totally UNHEALTHY characteristic. It's cruel to think a defect of a creature is something you can buy.
So, you should not listen to any scam claiming the Blue Frenchies are good rare. If you buy from those evil breeders, you unintentionally encourage this illegal mating. Keep in mind that any Frenchie breeding program is so expensive that there can't be a "cheap dog."
After all, we couldn't determine what is behind this dilute gene. But we know this recession presents not only in French Bulldogs but also in other breeds.
Naturally speaking, it's not defined as a defect of all existing livings. Admittedly, it is not true to say that this diluted gene contamination in the gene pool because it only affects the hair and eye; not the health of the dog as a whole. But what makes it not recognized is the temptation in triggering this gene leads to false breeding resulting in weak puppies in the line. That is against the community's will to have only healthy bred dogs or naturally born Frenchies.
Believe it or not, we have found no proven fact for this dilute gene to be responsible for any health defects in the Blue French Bulldogs. As we claimed, the reasons behind all those negative controversies for sick puppies, the results of poor breeding. A blue Frenchie is no different from a lilac or chocolate colored French bulldog except for the color. There is the fact that all Frenchies are susceptible to diseases. That can count their narrow nozzle, tuck-in tail, low-profile body, unusual temperament, and more of other breed-distinctions. That leads us to believe in the quality of the mated dog. It matters more than the color itself. Also, we never lose our integrity in the breeding lab. Because we only want to breed the healthiest puppies so that they can enjoy their whole life with happiness and fulfillment. Again, we confirm that a Blue Frenchie is not a weaker variation, but it is the inbreeding causing them poor health. And we, at Ethical Frenchie, will never deliver unhealthy dogs to live.
Another question raised in the community is about the breed standard of blue Frenchies. Well, we all know that there is no approval to promote this breeding as there is no science to back up a breeding session of Blue French pups. There have been too many irresponsible breeders taking advantage of producing disqualified blues to earn profits. In 1911, when the demand for blue Frenchies peaked, the disqualifications were spread. But in modern days, it seems less severe.
At present, blue Frenchies are becoming more popular than ever. In Europe, blue Frenchies are accepted as a standard. However, European Standards don't confirm they would approve some color variations that allowed by AKC.
So, we've got some pieces of advice for those you are thinking of buying a French bulldog. The first thing is you should consider the breeder you are meeting with. Ask the person if he has any license, past work, and reputation. You may prepare some questions to test the integrity of the breeders. Watch his concern about the dog's health and listen to him if he knows what is good and bad about a blue Frenchie. You may observe his desire to sell a blue pup to conclude if his attitude toward selling this rare breed is of profits or for the sake of the dog. It's better to equip yourself some knowledge before looking to any buy a blue Frenchie. Don't trust any one-sided debate or you can fall into the hype for a budget French pup.
FYI, most blue French pups appear with unique sapphire blue eyes as they are small. That blue brindled eye color will turn to medium brown or yellow when the dog grows larger. For eyes that have blue fawn or piebald, in the mature time, the dogs will have a blue-grey, light tan, or yellowish gold. In some cases, you may see those eyes in greenish or grey color.
We'd also want to add that AKC will approve even disqualified blue French bulldogs to be the standard. That means you can still get your blue mottled, white, or grey dog registered with AKC. While the mother variations of white, grey, and brindle are available, your Frenchies will get a certificate registered under those natural fawn colors.
