title: About Theo
---

### Personality: Hey! My name is Theo, I’m the cool guy of the litter. 
I’m a Blue French Bulldog puppy for sale located in New York City. Also i have a little white patch under me which looks like an upside down heart!. 
You won’t see another French Bulldog Puppy like me strutting the streets of NYC.  
I’m loving, playful but also like to keep my brothers and sisters on their toes. They definitely get their daily amount of exercise with me in the house.

### Health: I don’t even have to explain how healthy I am, my running around and jumping explains it. 
Blue French Bulldog Puppies look grey, which is an offshot of the original "black" colored frenchies. This also means i have one less "layer" of hair, which is great for the summer, but i'll need cute outfits to keep me warm outside in the winter.  I'd love nothing more than the best quality shampoo to keep my coat looking clean and shiny. Blueberry Shampoo baths at the groomer are my favorite. 

I recommend using this hypoallergenic shampoo. 
Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heatworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 
Vet will issue a fresh health certificate before I leave.
 
### Feeding: Theo, just like his siblings eats the same mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet Chicken food. 
But he does like to pace around when the adults are being fed – they are being fed a raw diet. So it looks like little Theo has a very big interest in the raw diet himself. Hmmm?

Theo is also getting his daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement from The Natural Pet Company. I’m obsessed with every product they put out and they work great for French Bulldogs and their sensitive skin.
