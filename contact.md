## How to contact Ethical Frenchie

> The application process is critical, since we're not a puppy mill we spend a lot of our valuable time makiing sure you're a good fit, and that this isn't an impulive decision on your part. Taking in a puppy is big responsibility.

 > Due to overwhelming volume, All inquireis must begin with the chat.
  (Pink Icon, on bottom right of your screen), it will have and answer all your questions including scheduling a visit or call.  (bottom right of your screen)

## Here are the questions that the chat will answer.

 The chat will do the following.
 - Weed out the "tire kickers"
 - Ask a few qualifying questions
 - Set your expectations regarding adoption cost.
 - Schedule a time (you'll receive an email and calendar invite) to chat today (or whenever is convenient)

 > Renee and I are quite busy cleaning up and chasing around after puppies, if we answered each contact form submission (which is what used to be here) it would take us 8hrs a day.   So pelase take no offense, if you were looking for an ethical breeder whom cares more about the puppies, you found the right place.

 - I actively maintain and update this site daily, 
 - If a puppy is not available it will not be on the site. Also if no puppies are availalbe it will display as such, and only show an upcoming litter. However there may be a "Partner Puppy" availble. (More on that when we speak)
 - Just use the pink chat thing, Trust me, my cell phone will vibrate the moment you do -James
