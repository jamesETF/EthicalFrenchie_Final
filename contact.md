## Use The Chat
(purple icon on bottom right)

### All families looking to bring home a puppy must begin by telling us about themselves. 
#### This is not another website where you can simply *Add a french bulldog puppy to your shopping cart.
Ethical Frenchie places just as much emphasis on evaluating the families as we do in evaluating and controlling the quality and ethical breeding practices that they would expect. Whether we bred the puppy ourselves or not, you can be sure that we go out of our way to "match" the perfect future furbabies with the right families.

We are being even more selective during our interviews for potential puppy adopters.  In order to be considered for a puppy from Ethical Frenchie, you must begin with the chat widget (purple icon on bottom right)
