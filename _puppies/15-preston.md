### Personality: 
Meet Preston! Preston is our blue French Bulldog puppy and he’s located in Manhattan, New York. He’s too young to strut the street but he visited multiple bars in his baby carrier and loved every minute of it. Preston is very bonded with his sister Pepper and it’s sometimes so hard to tell them apart. This sweet blue boy is kind, friendly and an explorer. He loves sniffing around and putting his little toys in a pile. It’s his hobby. Toy obsessed is an understatement. Preston is far from an alpha male and he gets along with just anyone, so if there is a family that’s loving and potentially already has a Frenchie that’s looking for a buddy, Preston might be your baby boy.

### Health:
Preston is up to date on all his age appropriate shots, dewormed multiple times and grew under strict veterinary supervision from the day she was born. We have two personal vets who examine our French Bulldog Puppies on multiple occasion and make sure there aren’t any deviations. Our pups usually come with two boosters of DHHP and Bordatella, as well as the completion of those and a rabies shot in case they stay with us longer. 
They also get microchipped and our vet issues an up to date health certificate before sale. 
French Bulldogs tend to have sensitive skin, so make sure on Omega 3 supplement becomes a part of your daily routine. 



### Who is Preston a good fit for?
Adding a Frenchie to your family Is a big commitment. Please consider adding Preston to your family - only if you are responsible, caring and ready to commit to this pup for the next 10+ years. French Bulldogs also have a preference for humans that work from home or work in a doggie friendly office, since being alone for long hours everyday is a no-no for this breed. 
 
### Feeding:
Frenchies thrive on fresh as well as raw food. They are currently fed a mixture of kibble combined with Fresh Pet dog food. I recommend gradually transitioning to a Fresh food brand only. It supports healthy stomach flora and consequentially keeps the immune system in balance.
The pups also get a daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement, as well as a probiotic a few times per week. 
What we expect from the new family feeding wise is investing in a high quality brand that works for this breed and will keep any kind of allergies or major issues at bay. I can’t say this enough – FOOD is very important.
