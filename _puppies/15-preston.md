### Personality: 
Hi there! My name is Preston and I love sitting and sleeping in weird positions. Iâ€™m a blue Frenchie puppy located in NYC and more than excited to go home. I could tell you so much about me, but Iâ€™m trying to figure out where to start. First of all I donâ€™t like my name, so hopefully my new humans will be more creative. Please feel free to message Ethical Frenchie with name suggestions. 
Other than being in need of a name replacement my life is pretty great so far. I can tell you Iâ€™m truly the sweetest boy you will ever meet. So much love in such a tiny body. Iâ€™m not a demanding Frenchie and I can be pretty independent. I love picking up my toys and walking to my crate where I can spend hours just chewing away before I pass out. If provided with enough deer antlers and chewing toys, you wonâ€™t even know Iâ€™m there. 
I love going places and exploring new bars in the neighborhood. Iâ€™ve visited the local bar down the street and I already feel like Iâ€™m a regular. After all my vaccines are done I will be able to take it to another level and actually explore the bar from ground up, sniffing every corner and find every bread crumb that was dropped on the floor. 
If you need a bar buddy â€“ Iâ€™m your man, if you need a Netflix buddy â€“ Iâ€™m your man, If you need a cuddle buddy â€“ yup thatâ€™s me. Long story short Iâ€™m everything you need and winter is soâ€¦ I think you should come visit.

### Health:
Iâ€™m a happy, healthy little boy. Up to date on all my age appropriate vaccines, dewormed multiple times (you need to keep up the dewormings every few months), microchipped and will come with a health certificate as well as a health guarantee. 
You will get plenty, plenty and I mean plenty instructions on my care from my mother, as well as products she recommends using. I would not recommend making her mad by not keeping up with my care and making me the most spoiled boy in the world. 


### Who is Preston a good fit for?
Iâ€™m looking for a family or a human that will take me places. I love to be surrounded by people and receive as many cuddles as possible. Itâ€™s on my bucket list to receive cuddles on every continent ðŸ˜‰ so if you like to travel I think we might be the perfect match. If you donâ€™t, no worries, you will just have to compensate by giving me 10x more cuddles. 
 
### Feeding:
Ohhh breakfast, lunch, dinnerâ€¦my favorite parts of the day. I take my time to enjoy a good meal. I like some Bone Broth added to my food to make it extra soft and easy to digest. Mother also ads a probiotic to my meals a few times per week. I canâ€™t complain. Life is good.
