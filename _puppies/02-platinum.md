### Lilac Platinum Frenchies with Blue eyes
Prince Harry & William are a rare exception to the French Bulldog world, It is not often you will see a "Platinum" french bulldog, the only thing more rare is a Furry. Thes platinum puppies are 2 of 3 (one is in North Carolina). They are so rare, that We believe there are fewer than 2 in New York.

Because they are so exceptional and rare, you should not inquire about them unless you are aware that they are on the higher end regarding price, and if you've done your homework regarding the cost of french bulldogs in general, you should not inquire unless you are financialy prepared and serious.

Typically we have a well written bio on each puppy, complete with personality traits and other details. In this instance, these two will not be around long, and they are very likely to actually end up in a Penthouse on Madison Ave or Rodeo drive.

Currently 12 weeks old as of 2/11/2020
