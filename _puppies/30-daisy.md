### Personality: 
Oh dear God..Itâ€™s so hard for me to type up this description after the day of torture I encountered. My parents decided to expose me to the outside world called Madison Square Park for the first time and it was beyond scary for me. I donâ€™t know  whatâ€™s wrong with my siblings and why they enjoyed it but Iâ€™m still suffering the consequences of this horrible incident. And they carried me around In this baby pouch, ughhhâ€¦. I think I need to be saved by a new family, and ASAP.  To do so call the emergency number  (212) 739-0182 today!
But before that let me introduce myself, Iâ€™m Daisy and Iâ€™m not as grumpy as I sound. Iâ€™m very sweet and shy when I meet people for the first time, thatâ€™s why I was beyond overwhelmed with so many people and obnoxious taxi honking. When I get to know you better and you win my heart Iâ€™m the most loving and devoted little French Bulldog pup you will ever meet. Iâ€™m located in NYC and you know â€¦ just trying to find my perfect match!

### Health:
Iâ€™m as healthy as a little Frenchie pup can be. Iâ€™m a tiny lady and still got a lot of growing to do. Iâ€™m the smallest out of all my siblings, and my parents donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll get any bigger than 20 lbs. My mom was on the smaller side as well, so it kinda makes sense. 
Iâ€™m up to date on all my shots, dewormed multiple times and  yesterday my vet told me Iâ€™m good to go. I will get examined one more time before departing for my forever home and my vet will issue a new health certificate on the day of the sale. 
You will get instructions and blogs on how to keep a Frenchie babe like me in top health with healthy food, wellness check ups and frequent grooming. 
 
### Who is Daisy a good fit for?
If I could pick â€“ my perfect home would be one with a backyard (a girl can dream right). My humans will get specific instructions on how to spoil me and any deviation from that will result in serious consequences of me peeing on their rug ðŸ˜‰ 
My ideal new hoomans are patient and live a quiet and relaxed life. Iâ€™m not a big fan of bars or loud places,  I do however enjoy cuddles and quality time. Do you think Iâ€™m the right girl for you? Contact Ethical Frenchie to schedule a meeting!
 
### Feeding:
All my siblings and I eat a mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet food. I have a tendency of eating fast so mom got me a slow feeding bowl. I guess I could thank her :P 
I eat 2-3x per day, and occasionally snack on some Stella & Chewyâ€™s dog treats. I love those things! They keep my tummy full in between meals. 
I also get a daily multivitamin as well as an Omega 3 supplement. 
All Frenchies should be given a glucosamine join supplement as well, through out their life to prevent joint problems. Keeping the weight down in combination with the joint supplements, should completely eliminate any risk for arthritis or hip dysplasia in the old age.
