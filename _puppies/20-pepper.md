### Personality: 
Meet Pepper! She is a solid blue French Bulldog girl located in New York City. Pepper is a social butterfly. She loves attention and receives it everywhere she goes. Her favorite things in this world are deer antlers, kong toys and Salmon Omega 3 treats. She is very smart and will be fairly easy to train. On the other hand, she got us trained in a second ðŸ˜‰ 
Pepper is not demanding but of course like every Frenchie she prefers company over solitude. This little blue Frenchie girl will thrive in a household with people that will spoil her and give belly rubs on demand.  

### Health:
Pepper is up to date on all her age appropriate shots, dewormed multiple times and grew under strict veterinary supervision from the day she was born. We have two personal vets who examine our French Bulldog Puppies on multiple occasion and make sure there arenâ€™t any deviations. Our pups usually come with two boosters of DHHP and Bordatella, as well as the completion of those and a rabies shot in case they stay with us longer. 
They also get microchipped and our vet issues an up to date health certificate before sale. 
Blue French Bulldogs have a single layer of coat and need to be protected from the elements in the winter. Make sure Pepper gets a fashionable outfit that she can parade around the streets of NYC.

### Who is Pepper a good fit for?
Adding a Frenchie to your family Is a big commitment. Please consider adding Pepper to your family - only if you are responsible, caring and ready to commit to this pup for the next 10+ years. French Bulldogs also have a preference for humans that work from home or work in a doggie friendly office, since being alone for long hours everyday is a no-no for this breed. 
 
### Feeding:
Frenchies thrive on fresh as well as raw food. They are currently fed a mixture of kibble combined with Fresh Pet dog food. I recommend gradually transitioning to a Fresh food brand only. It supports healthy stomach flora and consequentially keeps the immune system in balance.
The pups also get a daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement, as well as a probiotic a few times per week. 
What we expect from the new family feeding wise is investing in a high quality brand that works for this breed and will keep any kind of allergies or major issues at bay. I canâ€™t say this enough â€“ FOOD is very important.
