### Personality: 
Hey guys Iâ€™m Pepper. I honestly donâ€™t know why they called me Pepper, but apparently because Iâ€™m so spunky and brave. Iâ€™m a blue French Bulldog girl and Iâ€™m looking for my forever home. I just went outside for the first time today, we visited the park. Unfortunately I couldnâ€™t walk the streets just yet, because my shots arenâ€™t finished up. But I did love the outside, especially all the attention I got from strangers and them telling me Iâ€™m so cute! Iâ€™m ready to take over the NYC streets and Iâ€™m looking for a partner in crime. Someone brave, adventurous and clumsy when it come to dropping the food on the floor. Is you, the person reading it, my new hooman?

### Health:
Pawrents keep us healthy. Mom brushes our teeth â€“ she says itâ€™s very important to teach us about oral care from young age. I hate it, but I guess Iâ€™ll have to get used to getting my piranha teeth brushed â˜¹
Iâ€™ve been checked by our vet multiple times â€“ I love that guy! Even when it comes to him giving me shots â€“ Iâ€™m the best Pepper I can be. I still need some more vaccines before Iâ€™m fully protected against the outside world, so make sure you keep me up to date on shots. 
Iâ€™m already microchipped â€“ you are welcome. 
You will receive more instructions from my mom when you come visit. See you soon!

### Who is Pepper a good fit for?
Well, Iâ€™m not gonna lie, I can be a spoiled little Pepper, but donâ€™t worry, itâ€™s nothing you canâ€™t handle. My only requirements are: good food, frequent cuddles and watching Netflix shows that include random animals popping up on the screen. Other than that Iâ€™m pretty flexible and easygoing. So I think your time has come to pick up your phone and type in the special number  (212) 739-0182 and ask for Pepper. Thanks!
 
### Feeding:
Soooâ€¦.apparently I can only eat 2-3x per day. Life is so unfair sometimes for little Peppers like me. But whatever..letâ€™s just skip to what I eat when they finally decide to feed me. 
I eat a mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet Chicken recipe food. I lick the bowl clean, everytime. Iâ€™m small but donâ€™t underestimate my ability to eat. Food is the key to my heart, now you know it and now itâ€™s your opportunity to come and trick me into adopting you ðŸ˜‰
