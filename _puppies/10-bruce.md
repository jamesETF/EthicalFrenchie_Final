### Personality: 
Wohooo! Iâ€™m Bruce a blue pied French Bulldog puppy located in New York CIty! Thanks for clicking on my listing. 
Let me tell you a bit about myself. First of all â€“ Iâ€™m a fashinisto. I love dressing up and if you are going to adopt me you better prepare a whole wardrobe for me prior to me coming home, Iâ€™m spoiled like that. 
But other than that Iâ€™m the sweetest boy you will ever meet and donâ€™t worry I will prove that to you as soon as you walk through the door by greeting you with puppy kisses. I love other dogs, but Iâ€™m also very good with kids. I was raised in a house with multiple kids running around and playing fetch with me. I think yall get the hint â€“ I would love a big brother or sister!

Call my pawrents at Ethical Frenchie to see if you qualify to get adopted by a fancy guy like me!  



### Health:
Iâ€™m a very healthy boy. No issues at all here. Iâ€™ve been healthy since the day I was born and Iâ€™m growing by the day. I will be a middle sized Frenchie boy â€“ not too small and not too big, just perfect for the New York City lifestyle. Iâ€™ve been kept up to date on shots and my baby fat protected me from the scary needles â€“ I didnâ€™t feel a thing. 
There is a special recipe to keep a Frenchie healthy and that is good old fresh food. My human mother will give you all the instructions you need to keep me in top shape. She is very specific, so I do recommend you follow her recommendations ðŸ˜‰ 
Iâ€™m also microchipped already so you donâ€™t have to worry about that â€“ just make sure you finish the registration. Too many Frenchie pups get lost and canâ€™t be scanned due to an unfinished registration. 


### Who is Bruce a good fit for?
I know Iâ€™m adorable â€“ but please make sure taking me home is not an impulse decision. I want a family that is responsible and will spoil me in the long run. Whoever my new pawrents end up being â€“ you will have 0 regrets brining me home. Iâ€™m the perfect combo of funny, fashionable and lovable!
 
### Feeding:
I love food. There is not much to say about that. I love all food, but unfortunately, Iâ€™m not allowed to eat just anything, so for now Iâ€™m being fed a mixture of fresh food combined with some kibble. 
I also get a daily multivitamin by the Natural Dog Company â€“ no this is not an affiliate link; I just love the duck and potato formula. Our mom also gives us a daily Omega 3 supplement to support skin health at all times. 
I eat 2-3x per day, my last meal being before 6PM, so there are no poop accidents overnight, cause ainâ€™t nobody got time for that ðŸ˜‰
