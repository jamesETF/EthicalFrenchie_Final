### Personality: 
Hi, Charlie speaking. Thanks for clicking my listing. I’m a very sweet and polite little boy. I don’t cause trouble like my siblings do – I’m the good boi of the litter. If you decide to take me home, I promise I wont chew on your shoes, pee on your bed or stole the toilet paper. I almost had a home and was beyond excited to meet my new family. Unfortunately things don't always go as planned and the adoption fell through. I'm looking for a family that loves good boys with big bat ears and is ready to take me home soon. 

### Health: 
Look at me? Don’t I look like the chunkiest, healthiest little boy? I’m a merle, but I come from healthy bloodlines. My parents never struggled with any major issues and I know I’m going to thrive as well. But don’t forget we Frenchies do require special care and diet. 
I will be up to date on all age appropriate shots, microchipped and the vet will issue a fresh health certificate before sale. 

### Who is Charlie a good fit for?
Charlie is very flexible and he will do great with a family with kids as well as in a single person household. His energy levels are affected by the environment he's in. If a part of a very active family with kids, he will be playful and energetic until he wears himself out and takes a nap. If Charlie becomes a part of a more passive household he will have no problems just laying and cuddling next to you, or entertain himself by playing with his doggie toys. He truly is a good boi. 
  
### Feeding: 
All our French Bulldog Pups eat the same mixture of kibble and Fresh Food. They also get their daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement that keeps their coat healthy and shiny. Charlie has the most beautiful, softest coat, so let's keep it that way by feeding the right food and using organic grooing products.

We recommend adding a joint supplements to your dogs diet as well. It will help support and protect joints from injury.
