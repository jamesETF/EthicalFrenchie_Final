### Personality: 
Hello, I'm Nicole. Nice to meet you. I'm the calm blue frenchie girl that loves cuddles and has no issues launging with you on the sofa, or join you anywhere you want to go. I'm a good girl and don't cause trouble. I love human affection so yu can easily bring me to the office and i will be completely content by just being there and getting attention from strangers.


### Health: 
Blue French Bulldogs aren't any less healthier than other French Bulldog colors. I've been vet cleared multiple times and received almost all my shots already. I also recently got microchipped. Before i leave for my home our resident vet will additionally exam me and issue a health certificate confirming I'm a healthy blue frenchie pup.

### Who would be the best fit for Nicole?
Well Nicole is very easy going, but she will specially thrive in a home where all attention is on her in form of cuddles and petting. She would also be a good match for someone who is very social and loves to bring their dog everywhere. She is not one to cause conflict and will patiently sit and wait as long as she gets the cuddles she deserves. 

 
### Feeding: 
Feed Nicole 2-3 times per day. She, as well as all of our puppies, eat a mixture of kibble and Fresh Pet food. As she grows we recommend switching her to a raw diet, or a diet that mostly consists of fresh food. I really makes a big difference, especially for this specific breed.
