### Personality:
Hello guys! I'm small girl Violette. I’m a blue French Bulldog puppy for sale located in New York City,  and I’m beyond excited to meet my new potential pawrents.
I’m a sweet girl with just the right amount of attitude and sass. I promise you will never be bored with me by your side.

 Since I was a little tiny baby I had a habit of cuddling up to my favorite toy at nap time, so yea toys are my favorite. Make sure I get plenty of those if you take me home
.

### Health:  
I’m a healthy blue Frenchie for sale, and I’m basically ready to go to my forever home. All I need to do I let the vet examine me one more time, do another set of boosters as well as dewormers. 

I’m microchipped and will come with a fresh bill of health before I join you in my new furever home. 
Since I’m a light blue Frenchie girl you will have to make sure to keep my light coat in check. Use hypoallergenic shampoos and conditioner so my fur remains silky, clean and shiny.

 My mom also likes to add some Omega 3 supplements to my food, since that the purrrffect recipe to achive healthy skin/coat.

 ### Best fit for Violette?
 Hmmm, best fit for Violette would definitely be a couple/family that is active and ready to keep up with her energy levels. She needs someone who will match with her level of fun and take her out to explore the world. 

### Feeding:
Violette eats the same mixture of Fresh food and kibble just like her siblings do. Like we always say, we recommend switching your Frenchie to a completely raw diet, or at least boost it with some raw supplements.
