### Personality: 
Hey! My name is Nathan and I’m the little love bug of the litter.
I’m a blue French Bulldog puppy for sale located in New York City, so if you are looking for a blue Frenchie, I might just be your boy.

I’m sweet and friendly. I love kids and I would love to find a home where little humans would play with me and keep me company. I am outgoing and always ready for my next adventure. 
My perfect family would be one that’s not away a lot. I don’t like being alone and I would thrive with parents that either work from home or can bring me to their office. 



### Health: 
I’m a healthy blue Frenchie for sale, and I’m basically ready to go to my forever home. I will receive another vaccine booster, get dewormed and microchipped within the next few days. 
I’ve been screened by our vet multiple times and I’ve been cleared of any abnormalities. He actually said I’m a perfect little blue French Bulldog. 

Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heatworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 

Our in house veterinarian will issue a health certificate before I leave.

### Who is Nathan a good fit for?
Based on Nathan's behaviour we think his ideal family is one that is home often and is willing to give him all the attention and extra cuddles. He prefers to have his "person" near at all times. Once he pick you as his "person" you will represent his whole world. He is definitely not a good match for someone who works long hours or is just generally often absent. 

 
### Feeding: 
Nathan eats the same mixture of kibble and fresh food as all of our Frenchies do. You can always boost his meals by adding some fresh blueberries, goat milk or bone broth. 

Nathan is very food motivated and that makes him easy to train. We recommend you start the potty training process as soon as Nathan arrives to your home. Use treats and positive reinforcement and the process should be easy and painless.
