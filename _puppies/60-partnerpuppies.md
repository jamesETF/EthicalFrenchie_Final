### Partner Puppies: 

There are a lot of smaller breeders, whom aren’t as “Savvy” with the modern internet. I’ve seen French bulldog puppies listed in craigslist ads and in weekly “used car magazines”, that were only distributed in a small rural communities (Seriously), by happenstance I was getting gas and noticed puppies listed next to a used pickup truck.  

Now I collect probably 100’s of these small farmer trader, auto trader, & craigslist classifieds listings daily. 
I drive to these small towns and meet with the breeders, whom in a lot of cases have one litter per year, or maybe even one litter every 5-10 years.  I meet with them, hear their stories and usually make an offer.

The puppies listed as “Partner Puppies” are sourced from the relationships that I’ve built on the road and networking.  
Any French Bulldog puppy listed as Partner Puppy is one that I did not breed myself (I can’t keep up with the demand). I check to ensure that the breeder is doing everything correctly and that there is no puppy mill involved.  Once you take home a partner puppy you are given the contact information of that breeder if you have any questions.
Partner Puppies are covered by the same guarantee as our own puppies as I have very stringent requirements before I will associate my business with them.
