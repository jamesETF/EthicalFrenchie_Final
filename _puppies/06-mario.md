### Personality: 
Hey! My name is Mario. I will transform your life in a matter of seconds.
I’m a blue French Bulldog for sale in NY, so if you are located in this area, come meet me.

I’m spunky and always on the go. My favorite things are running up and down the house and mom surprising me with a brand new Kong toy. Especially If there is peanut butter in it.
I’m a super friendly boy and love meeting new people, animals and places. I’m well behaved and will be the star of the show no matter where we go. 


### Health:
Mario is sweet and healthy blue frenchie. He comes from genetically tested parents and healthy bloodlines, so with the right care from his new owners, Mario will live a long, healthy life.

Before Mario goes home our vet will issue a  certificate that confirms he is healthy, clear of any abnormalities and up to date on shots.

All our blue French Bulldog Puppies for sale get extensively examined by the vet before we even entertain the thought of placing them in their forever homes.

### Who is Mario a good fit for?
Mario is the happiest little guy, you can just tell by his smile. He would be  good match for a family that has other animals as well. Even though he can get completely consumed by his toys, he also enjoys major playtime with his siblings. Yes, we are talking about zoomies.
 
### Feeding:
Mario loves meal time. He will sit next to his bowl and patiently wait for his food to be ready. He will sit and wait on command, as well. Needles to say we have a very good boy here.

Like we previously mentioned we are huge supporters of raw feeding as well as fresh food feeding. We believe it goes a long way and will keep your Frenchie healthy, in great shape and free of allergies.
