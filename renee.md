### I Love you.
#### Please come home and sign.


To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't think could be real
To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a Three-fold utopian dream
You do something to me
That I can't explain
So would I be out of line, If I said
I miss you.
I see your picture, I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away
I know I'll see you again
Whether far or soon
But I need you to know, that I care
And I miss you


- There is a direct correlation between you arriving in my life, and the drive and motivation I had to provide.
- There is a clear state of panic and confusion on my end.
- I am very much lost without you.
- Because 50% of everything I do is for you.
- And I know that 50% of everything you do is for me. Just in your own way. And I accept this.

Its about time that was represented on paper and recognized by law.
A marriage can be desolved, A business is slightly more complicated, and there is no business without you.
I'm giving you half of what is yours, and half of what is mine.  Which is all of me. regardless of whether I see you again or not.
