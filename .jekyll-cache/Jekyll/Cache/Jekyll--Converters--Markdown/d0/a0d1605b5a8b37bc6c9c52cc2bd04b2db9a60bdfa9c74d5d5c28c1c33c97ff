<p>Hi! We‚Äôre James &amp; Renee, nice to meet you. We are a small, exclusive French Bulldog breeder located on the East Coast. Our breeding program is focused on extra care, socialization and improving the breed. We aren‚Äôt your typical ‚ÄúMom and Pops breeder‚Äù that has been around for 20 years.
We started breeding French Bulldogs 3 years ago but expanded our program in 2018. We are responsible, knowledgeable and caring which makes us stand out in the sea of faulty backyard breeders and puppy mills.
Our Female French Bulldog moms live happy lives and tend to have 1-2 litters only, before getting spayed. We breed standard French Bulldog colors, as well as exotic. If you are interested in blue French Bulldog puppies for sale ‚Äì we tend to have a couple of these beautiful litters per year.
The adult moms are placed with us and our close family members, which we like to call the ‚Äúdecentralized kennel system‚Äù. We are open to expanding our decentralized kennel to responsible and loving homes, so reach out for more information regarding that topic.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre passionate about what we do, but more importantly we understand the frustrations of searching high and low while trying to avoid scams and puppy mills alike.
We work diligently to ensure that we are following the best French Bulldog breeding practices and work extra hard to make sure your future family member is healthy &amp; socialized to fit your specific family‚Äôs needs.
After getting one of our French Bulldog Puppies puppies we offer life-time support when it comes to caring and raising your new French Bulldog or multiple French Bulldogs. If something happens you won‚Äôt be left alone in the dark ‚Äì we will assist you, so you can reach out anytime.</p>

<p>We started Ethical Frenchie because of what we saw as a lack of transparency and the proliferation of scam artists taking advantage of people when they are most vulnerable.</p>

<p>You can read a bit more about French Bulldogs Scams and how to avoid them by clicking here.</p>

<p>We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won‚Äôt offer full AKC registration on each and every puppy ‚Äì that‚Äôs not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out.</p>

<p>Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money. Not all dogs are meant to be bred (some of them lack the ‚Äústructure‚Äù, others are too small or too big and don‚Äôt fall under the ‚Äústandard‚Äù French Bulldog look), and not all people are qualified to breed (it‚Äôs irresponsible to give full breeding rights to every person that inquires about them).</p>

<p>Blue French Bulldog puppies for sale as well as other exotic colors require an extensive manual registration process, for that reason we - from this point on, don‚Äôt provide AKC registration on French Bulldogs that are sold solely as family pets. AKC registration will only be provided for a French Bulldog bought with full rights and intention to breed/show.</p>

<p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>
