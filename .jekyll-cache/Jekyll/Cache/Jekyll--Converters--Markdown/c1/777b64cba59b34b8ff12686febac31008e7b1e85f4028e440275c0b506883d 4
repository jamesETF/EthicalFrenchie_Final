I"à<p>Here at Ethical Frenchie we start the potty training process early on. Our puppies understand the â€œpottyâ€ command as early as 9 weeks of age. They mimic their mothers behavior and go â€œpottyâ€ outside every 2 hours. Positive reinforcement goes a long way. We canâ€™t promise they will be completely potty trained when you get them, but they will have the basic understanding of it.
