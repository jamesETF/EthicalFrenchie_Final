<p>The first time you will ever see or think the words â€œPizzazz &amp; Candorâ€ will be the day you have the privilege to meet me.  I am celebrity, I am Lord Admiral Nelson and I am seeking a human to adopt.  I have a few requirements for my human.</p>
<ol>
  <li>First of all they must understand that i cause traffic jams. Outside of â€œSunday Brunchâ€ in SOHO Iâ€™ve managed to bring quite a few ladies to tears. Iâ€™m simply irresistible, and due to this fact you will have to keep an eye on me at all times. Iâ€™m like a loose diamond rolling down the street on a leash. Donâ€™t take yoru eyes off me.</li>

<p>Iâ€™m considering a new primary care veterinarian, the one iâ€™m seeing insists i must wait in the lobby among theâ€¦ how should is say? â€œcommonpupsâ€.</p>

<p>We recommend using this hypoallergenic shampoo. 
Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heartworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 
Vet will issue a fresh health certificate before I leave.</p>

<p>Lord Admiral Nelson commands the puppies around him to step aside during his mealtime. He uses a spork and bib when consuming sampling the various delicacies chosen especially for him by his pet human.  Sometimes he chastises his human for switching the menu too abruptly as it tends to make him a tid bit gassy. He wants to be fed like a king and will most certainly bit the hand that feeds him (not literally, but maybe with a snarky look)</p>

<p>Lord Admiral Nelson is also getting his daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement from The Natural Pet Company. Iâ€™m obsessed with every product they put out and they work great for French Bulldogs and their sensitive skin.
