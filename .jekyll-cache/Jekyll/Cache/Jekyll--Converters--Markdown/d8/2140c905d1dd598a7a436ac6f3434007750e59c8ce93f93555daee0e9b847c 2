<p>I’m a lilac French Bulldog puppy for sale located in New York City. And not just a regular lilac, lilac with tan points, which makes me <strong>really rare</strong>. 
You won’t see another French Bulldog Puppy like me strutting the streets of NYC.<br />
I’m loving, playful but also like to keep my brothers and sisters on their toes. They definitely get their daily amount of exercise with me in the house.</p>

<p>Lilac French Bulldog Puppies for sale have a coat that is lighter than a regular blue coat, so they do need a quality shampoo to keep that light coat looking clean and shiny. 
We recommend using this hypoallergenic shampoo. 
Before I go home I will receive 2 sets of shots, heatworm prevention treatment, tick and flea treatment, deworming and I will also get microchipped. 
Vet will issue a fresh health certificate before I leave.</p>

<p>But he does like to pace around when the adults are being fed – they are being fed a raw diet. So it looks like little Ace has a very big interest in the raw diet himself. Hmmm?</p>

<p>Ace is also getting his daily multivitamin and Omega 3 supplement from The Natural Pet Company. I’m obsessed with every product they put out and they work great for French Bulldogs and their sensitive skin.
