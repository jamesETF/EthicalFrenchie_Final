I" <p>One of the most exciting parts of bringing home a Frenchie puppy is imagining all the memories youâ€™ll make and all the love youâ€™ll share with your new best friend. Unfortunately, there are people out there looking to capitalize on the happiness dogs bring to our lives. Unfortunately, some of the most desirable breeds are the most common targets of scams. Youâ€™ll find scams for French Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. And unfortunately, Frenchies are one of the most popular breeds used in these scams. French Bulldog scams can result in a loss of money or adopting a dog thatâ€™s not purebred, or even worse â€“ a dog with a serious illness like Parvo.</p>
