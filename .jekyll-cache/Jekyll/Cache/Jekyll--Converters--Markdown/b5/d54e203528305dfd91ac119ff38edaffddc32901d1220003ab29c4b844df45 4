I" <p>French Bulldog Puppies are expensive because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They cannot mate or breed naturally.</li>
  <li>They require artificial insemination</li>
  <li>French Bulldogs also cannot have natural births, each birth must be a C-Section.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, to help you with the costs you can apply for financing for one of our puppies through our partner.
Regardless of whether you have support or not:</p>
