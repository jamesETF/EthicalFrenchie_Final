<p>Many French Bulldog owners swear by the  <a href="https://www.servicedogcertifications.org/benefits-of-a-raw-food-diet-for-dogs/" title="raw dog diet benefits">raw dog diet</a>.

<p><img src="../uploads/Stella-Chewy-doog-food.jpg" alt="Image of Stella Chewy's Dog Food" title="Stella-Chewy-Dog-Food" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.stellaandchewys.com/" title="Stella and Chewy's Dog Food Brand">Stella and Chewy’s </a>is a very popular brand in the dog world. They are notorious for their dehydrated raw dinner patties, but I agree it can get costly.</p>

<p>Here is a more affordable alternative - <a href="https://www.stellaandchewys.com/dog-food/raw-coated-kibble/" title="Raw Coated Kibble Dog Food">raw coated high quality kibble</a>. Or kibble with dehydrated raw pieces.</p>

<p>I use their frozen raw food daily and I think it’s the <strong>best dog food for french bulldog with skin allergies.</strong> The ingredients are very limited and you can easily eliminate the allergen.</p>

<p>If you look at the ingredients of commercial <strong>kibbles</strong>, most of them contain fillers, but not that much meat. Meat is crucial for your dogs health and should always be the number 1st, 2nd and 3rd ingredient.</p>

<p><img src="../uploads/Fromm-Dog-Food-Kibble-1.jpg" alt="Image of a Fromm dog food kibble brand" title="Fromm-dog-food-kibble" /></p>

<p>Fromm has been and always will be a popular <strong>dog food brand</strong>. Since the FDA issued the potential link between certain <strong>dog food brands</strong> and <a href="https://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/outreach/Pet-Health-Topics/categories/diseases/dilated-cardiomyopathy-in-dogs" title="Heart Disease in Dogs">Canine Heart disease</a>, many people decided to do the switch.</p>

<p>But we have to keep in mind that the direct link was never proven, and the grain free dog food, was the only cause for concern. Fromm offers many whole grain dog food options that I would recommend to this day.</p>

<h3 id="simply-nourish"><strong>Simply Nourish</strong></h3>

<p><img src="../uploads/simply-nourish-dog-food-1.jpg" alt="Image of the Simply Nourish dog food in the brand new packaging" title="simple-nourish-dog-food" /></p>

<h2 id="to-summarize">To Summarize</h2>

<p>I hope you will be able to pick the <strong>best food for French Bulldog</strong> puppies and adults, after reading our blog.</p>

<p>My last recommendation would be - don’t rely on one specific <strong>dog  food brand</strong> and don’t be scared to mix it up. Mix your kibble with freshly prepared foods, or add some raw to your pup’s daily meal.  There is nothing wrong with diversity.</p>
