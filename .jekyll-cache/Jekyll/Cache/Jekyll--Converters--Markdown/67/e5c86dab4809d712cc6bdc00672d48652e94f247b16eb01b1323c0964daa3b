<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>You can call me Maxamillion. I am a blue French Bulldog puppy with a white chin and chest plate. I am the very definition of a bulldog. Do you see how thick my skull is? Well, my human says they have to register my head as a lethal weapon with the FBI. Now, just because I have a thick skull does not make me dumb. All you have to do is look in my eyes to see the intelligence I have. I get into everything. If it is not nailed down, I will get it. You have been warned! I am the go-getter of my siblings, unless it is playtime. Then, I am going to be the first to try everything! Me and my siblings live in a place called Manhattan. That is in New York City where there are lots of humans. We have a rooftop play area where we go out and play. We also take our most favorite type of bath ou5 there â a sun bath! We like to stretch out on our bellies with our back legs pointed away from our noses. Humans call it frog legs, but I do not look, smell, or taste like a frog! Not that I have ever tasted one; however, if I see one, I will probably try it.</p>

<p>I was born on 10/19/2019 and I am 10 weeks old, plus very healthy. I know this because I can hear when the vet tells my temporary humans. (They have no idea that I understand English as well as French. Shh.) When other humans first see me, they tell how masculine and bold looking I am. I will take their word for it. I do not really like mirrors because the dogs in those will not come out and play. I am so looking forward to interviewing for my new humans. I will study them closely and maybe even lick them to be sure I get the best one. I am very picky and will not go home with just anyone.</p>

<h2 id="personality">Personality</h2>

<p>If something is happening, I am probably in the middle of it â or I will be shortly. It all depends on what I am doing when I hear it. If I am getting petted, my ears scratched, my belly rubbed, or especially when I am eating, whatever it is can wait. Maybe I will nose around later. Me and my siblings love to chase balls; if you roll it, we will chase it and fight over it. Besides chasing balls, I love other toys. Because I am so inquisitive, I need lots of toys to keep me busy. Yeah, you probably think I am trying to trick you, but I am being honest. If you do not believe me, your chews will work as a toy. (Huh? I spelled it right. Chews are what humans wear on their feet.)</p>

<p>I know there are plenty of blue Frenchies fur adoption, but I will definitely make things in your household more interesting because I will find any trouble that tries to hide from me. I only do that to protect you. It would be bad if trouble found you. Keep that in mind before saying all of those French words to me. Guys, not to brag or anything, but I am a babe magnet. Girls, the hunks will swarm to get a chance to compare muscles with me. They are going to lose to this fab-body, but they can try.</p>

<h2 id="health">Health</h2>

<p>No question that I am healthy; I mean, look at this physique! The vet has seen me several times, and I have my shots. (Grrrrrrr!) Do not listen to the rumors about how us blue Frenchies have skin issues. None of my relatives have any problems with their skin or anything else. The secret is feeding me the right food, giving me healthy treats, petting me 32 hours per day, making sure I play, giving me healthy treats, giving me belly rubs, and using only quality bath products. (Did I mention treats?)</p>

<p>I am a Frenchie, and we have very particular needs. You should probably do a little research before getting your heart set on one of us. Our faces make us very desirable because it looks like we chased a cement wall. How many other animals have you seen whose eyes can look inside their own nostrils? Just kidding! Mostly. Brachycephalic is the name. It means our faces are squished flat and we sometimes have trouble breathing easily. Because of the short nasal passages, you better like snorting and snoringâ¦oh, and farting.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-need-in-a-human">What I Need in a Human</h2>

<p>You need to always be ready to play, and you better like buying me toys. When you buy toys, think of what a Tasmanian Devil with the bite force of an alligator will do to it. If it will last more than ten minutes, then that is a toy made fur a Frenchie. Of course, I LOVE pulling the stuffing out of toys, but you have to watch as I do because sometimes, I eat the stuff. (Hey! The commercials say to eat more fiber. If they did not mean that fiber, they should have said so.) I like long walks on trails, in the bark, I mean park, or on the beach, only you have to be sure it is not too hot or not too cold. Both can cause breathing problems after just a few minutes of exertion. I do need exercise, I do need to run, I do need to catch squirrels, and I do need to dig. The one thing I do not need to do is swim. Our bodies are made to sink like a pallet of bricks, and since we have no snout, swimming pushes water into our nostrils. Trust me; it is not a good thing. Now, playing in the rain is a different story. That [bleep], excuse my French, is fun!</p>

<p>I will be OK with a human that does not mind it when I do stupid things. You do know when to be the one in charge to keep me from wandering away from you. My temporary humans are making me tell you that Frenchies are very stubborn. (They said something very mean about us having thick skulls.) Since I am so curious about things, I add mystery to thick-headedness. You also need to like to cuddle â a lot. If you ever furget to give lots of belly rubs, I will remind you. Ooh, and ear scratches, those are important. Plus, you have to promise to take me to the vet regularly.</p>

<p>Now, stare deeply into my eyes, think of me cuddled up right next to you, you are feeling very relaxed. You are getting sleepy. At the sound of my next snort, snore, or fart, you will be entirely under my control. You will take me home with you. You will always spoil me and never get mad at me. You will automatically remember these instructions on the days of the week that have the letter âaâ in them. Now, I am going to slowly let you wake up from your trance. You will awaken with a keen desire to come get me. You will not be able to think of anything else until you do. OK, you are awake.</p>
