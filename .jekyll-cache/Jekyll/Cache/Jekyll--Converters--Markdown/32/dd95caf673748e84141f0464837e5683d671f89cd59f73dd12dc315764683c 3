  <li>We should make it clear that while we don’t recommend financing a pet, we do understand that the desire for comfort and a companion can be overwhelming.  Because of that we are working with Community Finance LLC via our kennel (Ethical Kennel) to provide that option those interested.</li>
  <li>We also don’t know what your APR will be, from our experience people have had payments around $100/month depending on how long they stretched it out.</li>

<p>You will need a “decent” credit rating to finance a french bulldog puppy, However it seems consistent employment and co-signers also help.  It should be noted that we also accept deposits and “lay-away” sort of puppy payment plans in house.  This is where you select a puppy at birth, and you make payments over the course of 2-3 months completing 80-ish percent of the payments before you take the puppy home.  This is of requires a background check and personality interview to ensure that you’re aware of what you are signing up for.</p>
