We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.</p><p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>"

Making sure they eat every 2 hours, that their temperature doesn’t drop, that they are all gaining weight equally and of course just observing their overall behavior – not missing something that would indicate a major health issue. But of course, the whole process of “producing a healthy French Bulldog” starts way before they are even conceived. Health testing the parents is the responsible thing to do. The last thing you would want is take a risk of dam or sire being a carrier or them having some kind of hereditary condition, that would only bring heartbreak and vet bills to the new potential family. After the French bulldog puppies are old enough, they get their first extensive vet visit. Only after their well being is confirmed and documented is when we start advertising our puppies/taking deposits.",

        "description": "The socialization of your French Bulldog puppy starts early. Since they are raised inside the house they get exposed to variety of sounds and people as soon as their “ears open” at around 10-14 days of age. Yes, all puppies are born deaf and blind – they rely on their sense of smell to crawl around and find their mother during “feeding time”. It’s hard to believe but some puppies show their dominance and alpha qualities at a very early age. We pay special attention to those and make sure we don’t enforce those traits. We try to establish ourselves as the leader of the pack, which will make your training easier once the puppy is in your care. By the time they are ready they understand the concept of peeing on the pee pad and those that stay with us longer are familiar with the “potty” command. Some are more stubborn than others, so consistency with training is key. You can read more about French Bulldog potty training here(https://ethicalfrenchie.com/potty-train-your-frenchie/). Overall exposing the puppies to positive and versatile experiences is what will predispose them to grow into stable, happy individuals with the absence of phobias and behavioral issues.",

We want to make sure the puppy is a match for your home, and that you will commit to accepting your new addition and caring for it for the next 10+ years. Don’t get one because it’s a trend, or because your neighbor has one and they look cute. They are funny and quirky but also delicate and require a lot of work. If you feel like your heart is in the right place and you are ready for the responsibility, we want you to know that we donate a portion of each puppy purchase to an organization of your or our choice.

<p>Hey! I’m James of Ethical Frenchie</p>

<p>Ethical Frenchie was started a few years ago as a small family French Bulldog breeding program that focuses on health, temperament and socialization. Our dogs are first and foremost beloved family pets. They receive high quality nutrition, great care, lots of love, affection as well as training and stimulation.</p>

<p>But our vision was much bigger than that. As some of you know we worked hard for the past few months at researching and vetting out different breeders. We finally narrowed it down to a few who we felt comfortable with and know have the same vision of producing healthy French Bulldog Puppies. So as of October 2019, the puppies on our website will not be only bred by us directly, but also by our group of Ethical breeders.</p>

<h2 id="were-passionate">We’re passionate</h2>
<p>About what we do, but more importantly we understand the frustrations of searching high and low while trying to avoid scams and puppy mills alike.
We work diligently to ensure that we are following the best French Bulldog breeding practices and work extra hard to make sure your future family member is healthy &amp; socialized to fit your specific family’s needs.
After getting one of our French Bulldog Puppies puppies we offer life-time support when it comes to caring and raising your new French Bulldog or multiple French Bulldogs. If something happens you won’t be left alone in the dark – we will assist you, so you can reach out anytime.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-do-it">Why We Do It</h2>
<p>We started Ethical Frenchie because of what we saw as a lack of transparency and the proliferation of scam artists taking advantage of people when they are most vulnerable.</p>

<p>You can read a bit more about French Bulldogs Scams and how to avoid them by <a href="https://ethicalfrenchie.com/4-signs-of-a-french-bulldog-scam-and-4-ways-you-can-avoid-them-ethical-frenchie/">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>The goal is to make Ethical Frenchie a website where every potential Frenchie adopter comes and feels completely comfortable and at peace with knowing these puppies were raised in real homes with loving people that are passionate and want to improve the overall health of the breed.</p>

<p>We are completely transparent about which puppies were bred by us directly and which came from other breeding homes. After you take the puppy home you are put in direct contact with the original breeder and can send them updates, ask questions and form a relationship. They care about the placement of their babies and would of course prefer to keep in touch and watch their little Frenchie grow.</p>
